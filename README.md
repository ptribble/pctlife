This is a trivial hacked together in half an hour implementation of
John Conway's game of Life.

Just run the life script. If you would like to change the parameters
(such as the size of the simulation) then edit the code and recompile.

Updated version 1.1 adds the menu bar, allowing you to exit, start
over, and change the colours.

Updated version 1.2 allows the import of a life pattern, from the
command line (simply supply the filename as an argument to the
script). You can also modify the speed of the simulation, the
default speed is faster, and performance is much improved. A collection
of Life patterns, and alternative applications, are available from the
following URL:

Updated version 1.3 allows running as a java applet - see the
lifeapplet.html file.

Version 1.4 is fully packaged, including a custom application icon and
desktop file

The applet has now been removed, as nothing on the modern web will run it.

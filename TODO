TODO for pctlife

finish package creation
 - postinstall script (image cache)

Add pause/resume; save while paused?

Add load of a life pattern from the menu

Support other life rules (as in the #R specifier in the life pattern
format).

Make it faster; much faster (probably accelerated graphics)

Autoscale to allow the import of the larger life patterns.
